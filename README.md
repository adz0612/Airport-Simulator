Airport Simulator
Giancarlo M. Guerra

This C program simulates an airport with two runways, one for landings and another for takeoffs. 
Airplanes are created and placed in a landing queue or a takeoff queue. The program gives preference
to landings over takeoffs. A final tally of total landings and takeoffs, plus the contents of each queue
is displayed at the end of the simulation

Every airplane is assigned an int value
The simulation runs for 120 steps

To execute(from command line):
            1. gcc -o whatever name you wanna put it main.c
            2. ./whatever name you wanna put it
